    <h1>Train Tracked</h1>
    <p>
      A 'better' UK train tracking app. Created as part of a Level 5 Computer Science project at the University of
       Portsmouth
    </p>
    <p>
      Developed using Flutter, Dart and the Rail Delivery Group's delightful
       <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/developers/darwin-data-feeds/">Darwin API</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Open Source! The moderation period has ended and marks have been released, so I can now safely release this
       project as open source software!
      <br>The <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/train-tracked">front end</a> and
       <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/train-tracked-api">back end</a> are both available now on Github!
    </p>
    <p>
      I intend to release Train Tracked on the Google Play Store Soon<span class="superscript">TM</span>, and as a direct
       download now (Get it <a href="assets/train-tracked.apk">here</a>, updated 17-07-2024). However, an iOS
       release is looking unlikely as I do not own any Apple devices (Why Apple, do I need a mac to publish for iOS?)

    <h1>Demo</h1>
    <p>
      Below is a simple demo to show that the Train Tracked API can return data from Darwin

      Please note, this demo does not currenly work due to a CORS issue. I've tried to look into it but its basically
       black magic to me, with my current knowledge of it :/
