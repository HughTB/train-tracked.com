        <p>A 'better' UK train tracking app. Created as part of a Level 5 Computer Science project at the University of Portsmouth. Developed using Flutter, Dart and the Rail Delivery Group's delightful <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/developers/darwin-data-feeds/">Darwin API</a>

      <h1>Now open source!</h1>
      <p>The moderation period has ended and marks have been released, so I can now safely release this project as open source software!<br>
        The <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/train-tracked">front end</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HughTB/train-tracked-api">back end</a> are both available now on Github!

      <h1>Get it now!</h1>
      <p>Train Tracked should be on the Google Play Store Soon&trade; (updated 12-08-2024). However, an iOS release is looking unlikely as I do not own any Apple devices (Why Apple, do I need a mac to publish for iOS?)
