    <h1>Train Tracked</h1>
    <p>
      A 'better' UK train tracking app. Created as part of a Level 5 Computer Science project at the University of
       Portsmouth
    </p>
    <p>
      Developed using Flutter, Dart and the Rail Delivery Group's delightful
       <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/developers/darwin-data-feeds/">Darwin API</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      While currently closed-source, both the front-end and back-end intermediary API will become fully open-source under
       the GPL-2.0 license, after the grading and moderation period (Late summer 2024). Check here for updates
    </p>
    <p>
      I intend to release Train Tracked on the Google Play Store Soon<span class="superscript">TM</span>, and a direct
       download now (Get it <a href="assets/train-tracked.apk">here</a>, updated 15-01-2024). However, an iOS release is
       looking unlikely as I do not own any Apple devices (Why Apple, do I need a mac to publish for iOS?)

      Below is a simple demo to show that the Train Tracked API works
      <br>(Yes I did make this look like it does in the app, because I was bored)
